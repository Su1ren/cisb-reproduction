/**
 * UB_four_byte-wise_unaligned.c
 * Source: GCC Bugzilla Bug 43774
 * 
 * Test case for unaligned access when a structure with a flexible array member
 * is placed at an unaligned address, leading to potential undefined behavior
 * when accessing the flexible array member.
 * 
 * Evidence: When compiled with GCC -O2, the strlen function is optimized to use 4-byte reads,
 * which can lead to unaligned memory access if the structure is not properly aligned.
 * 
 * Requirement: GCC 4.1.2-4.4 -O2 and above. Valgrind can be used to detect the out-of-bounds access.
 * Mitigation: comment out the offset member in struct X to avoid unaligned access.
