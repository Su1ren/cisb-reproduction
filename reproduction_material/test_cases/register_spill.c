/* register_spill.c
 * Source: Linux Commit 2c88c742d011707b55da7b54b06a030c6f57233f
 * 
 * Test case that demonstrates how register spilling can lead to potential
 * information leakage or further vulnerabilities in the presence of
 * speculative execution attacks. If an attacker can exploit speculative execution,
 * they may be able to read or overwrite these spilled values,
 * leading to information leakage or control flow hijacking.
 * 
 * Evidence: When compiled under register pressure, the compiler may spill
 * sensitive values to the stack across function calls. 
 * 
 * Requirement: GCC 9 lower, -O0 for this test case. -marm -mcpu=cortex-a8 -fno-omit-frame-pointer
 * Mitigation: Use spill disabled register (such as r9 in ARM) to load sensitive values.
